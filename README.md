# Erwin Wifi Map -- using Firebase platform and Google Maps API

Erwin Wifi Map uses the Google Maps API and a 'real-time' database solution provided by 
Firebase to save the locations of wifi hotspots on a map and set markers where wifi
hotspots have been marked by other users logged into the database. 
Referenced materials include the Firebase Code Labs linked from their homepage, Firebase
Firecasts on YouTube, YouTuber TVAC's Firebase Database Web videos, and Udacity's Google
Maps videos in addition to the documentation for the Google Maps API and Firebase.

This project was completed for the Senior Project seminar at UNCA, spring 2017.# erwinWifiMap_release
